# Contributing:
I appreciate each and every commitment that is pushed to this project! Thanks for checking it out!

## Contributing guidelines:
- If you make a major overhaul to the UI, make it clear in your commit message/pull request message.
- Do not expect all of your changes to be in the final product. They may be tweaked, or even removed. With this, if there is something that you don't like, you may remove it as well.
- Be mature. If you try to be funny and attempt to delete all the files, I simply won't merge your pull request. If you attempt this numerous times, you will be blocked from this repository, along with the rest of my (PJBeans') repositories.

## User Interface guidelines:
- The background should be a fixed color or an abstract image.
- Use good fonts. That means don't use Comic Sans.
- Keep the UI simple.

## Adding a video to Verues:
Checkout the `README.md`. In a nutshell: 
- Ensure to warn the user of violent/mature audience content.
- You may NOT upload pornography of anykind.
- You can either upload your video directly to Verues and add it with an HTML tag, or embed the video from YouTube.
