		<p>Verues has only been alive for a few days, but the site has grown alot with the efforts of just two people. We have a few things set up already, including:<br>
		<br>
		- The internal site structure (folders, pages, etc.)<br>
		- A temporary logo (it kinda sucks right now)<br>
		- A test video<br>
		- An embedded test video from YouTube<br>
		- A blog<br>
		- A "Contact Us" Page.
		</p>
		<p>
		We plan to add the following soon:<br>
		<br>
		- A method to upload videos without using Git
		</p>
		<p>To anyone who checks out this site, thank you! We ask that you will hop on the Verues train as it improves in the future.</p>
