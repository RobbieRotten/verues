			<p>-A place to find great, original content.<br>
			-A completly free to use, ad free* website<br>
			-Open sourced (Anyone can modify it.)<br></p>
			<font size="5"><h2>What it isn't:</h2></font>
			<p>-A place to upload content (You must link your videos to a trustworthy website**)<br>
			-An adult-only website; Content should stay at a PG-13 raiting at the most, unless it is clearly<br>
			noted the content is intended for an older audience (No pornography of any kind).<br>
			-A place to show off your school project. As much as we appreciate anyone who contributes their<br>
			work here, we do not want to see the first project you made in iMovie or Movie Maker. Please<br>
			show that you are somewhat experienced in video making to publish your content.</p>
			<font size="5"><h2>Code of Conduct:</h2></font>
			<p>1. No one under the age of 13 shall attempt to add their content to the site. If it is<br>
			apparent that the video was made fast by an inexperienced user, it will be removed from the<br>
			website.<br>
			2. No unclarified adult content. Do not mix adult content with the rest of the site. If you<br>
			would like to upload content to the site intended for adult viewers, ensure you give 5-10<br>
			seconds in your video along with a clear warning for viewers who do not want to see that<br>
			kind of content a chance to click off.
			3. Titles must follow the following guidelines: "Title - Season #, Episode #" for the<br>
			video to remain on the site. Do not upload click-baity titles just to grab attention<br>
			4. Only upload entertainment content, and content that is yours. By linking a video<br>
			to this site, you claim all rights to the video; you made the video. Videos that infringe<br>
			on one's copyright will be removed from the site immediatly. In addition to this, only upload<br>
			content that is entertainment -- acted content or animated, in any genre, comedy, education, etc.<br>
			That means that you should not upload tutorials, gaming videos, or self-promotion videos (e.g.: Thanks<br>
			for 10,000 followers on Instagram!). We discourage talk shows, but if you really want to start one,<br>
			please keep it to a weekly-or-greater (weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.) schedual.</font></p>
