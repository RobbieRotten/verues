# Virues
Please note: Virues is not functional in its current state. It is not ready for public use. If you would like to help the site, feel free to contribute.

Virues will be a free website that allows creators to publicize their work. It will allow users to embed their videos in a template, and add a link to that on the home page. They will add their link to the top, so when you upload your work, users will see it.
It will be completly open sourced, so anyone can improve the site as time goes on.
