# Verues
Please note: Verues is not 100% functional in its current state. Please expect bugs, and for things to be out of place.. If you would like to help the site, feel free to contribute. The contents of this Read Me may or may not be implemented yet in the final product.

Verues will be a free website that allows creators to publicize their work. It will allow users to embed their videos in a template, and add a link to that on the home page. They will add their link to the top, so when you upload your work, users will see it.
It will be completly open sourced, so anyone can improve the site as time goes on.
